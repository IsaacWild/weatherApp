# weatherApp

This is my weather app for the Odin project.

## Description

For the Odin project, we were tasked to learn how to interact and use APIs to create a simple weather app taking in user prompts and displaying the requested data back to them.

This was my first project using API we had made a mini project using the Giphy API to receive and display a random GIF on a users text prompt but it was a very guided and simple project to help understand the JSON system used with APIs when sending and receiving back the data.

I found the initial implementation of the project and using the API a little difficult but after reading through the documentation and testing different parts of the API with the project as I was working through I was able to reach the goals I set out and implemented the API fetch requests into the project using promises to ensure our Javascript was able to continue working Asynchronously and not freeze or break on waiting for a faulty request. 

With this being my first project with APIs and Asynchronous code I am very happy with my results. I chose for a mobile first design with a simple colour scheme, the site works n desktop but I have no optimisation for the layout in my CSS, due to other time constraints and pressures I was unable to fully commit the time I would have liked to the project but returning I would like to add in a full desktop layout, more choice for weather forcast along with better utilisation and rounding of received weather data from the API and use error handling for when a inputted place name is not fround in the location API.
